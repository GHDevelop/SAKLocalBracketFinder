This Java-based Android application allows users to find the bracket link for the latest weekly brackets at the SAK Gaming Lounge. SAK Gaming runs 2 weekly events; Sink or Swim on Thursdays and The Smash Lab on Fridays. This program allows users to easily find the bracket for the event that is running on that day. The program has 4 core components. The activity scene is the XML-based UI that the user interacts with, containing a dropdown list, a text field, and an image button. The activity script is a java class that generally allows the UI to interface with the other classes. The Spinner Activity Events script contains the listeners for when the selected item in the dropdown is changed. The Bracket Loader determines the URL for the event and loads it into the phone's web browser.
